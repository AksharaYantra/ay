		<p class="sub-heading">
			Irving, TX, July 02, 2021 - Akshara Yantra is excited to announce the launch of
			our Patent Pending Technology to Increase Rainfall that subsequently reduces Wildfires in West US States.

		<p>
			West US States (UTAH, NEVADA, ARIZONA, CALIFORNIA, etc.) are facing Wildfires and moderate to severe drought
			due to lack of proper rainfall. It is estimated that billions of dollars are spent to address the problem,
			but no suitable solution could be arrived at. <i>Akshara Yantra has a clean and green solution that can be
				implemented to obtain abundant rains that subsequently mitigates droughts, wildfires, restores water and
				power supply</i>.
		</p>

		<p>
			There were more than 30,000 fire incidents that burned about 1.4 million acres. In 2020, wildfires were
			catastrophic with about 10 million acres were burned with about 59,000 fire incidents lost 10,000 structures
			and 33 fatal deaths.
		</p>
		<p>
			California spent about $700 million for suppression of the wildfires for the 2019/2020 fiscal year.
		</p>
		<p>
			Akshara Yantra is a research-oriented scientific company to address environmental and
			atmospheric challenges such as droughts, wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, air pollution, etc.
			Akshara Yantra aims to provide cost effective, clean, green, and innovative methodology
			using its patent pending technology to renew ecosystem, environment, and atmosphere.
