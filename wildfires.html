	 <p class="sub-heading">
		Irving, TX, July 02, 2021 - Akshara Yantra is excited to announce the launch of our Patent Pending Biomass Combustion Process to Increase Rainfall that subsequently Reduces Wildfires in West US States.

	 <p>
	 West US states (UTAH, NEVADA, ARIZONA, CALIFORNIA, etc.) are facing Wildfires and moderate to severe drought due to lack of proper rainfall. It is estimated that billions of dollars are spent to address the problem, but no suitable solution could be arrived at. <i>Akshara Yantra has a clean and green solution that can be implemented to obtain abundant rains that subsequently mitigates droughts, wildfires, restores water and power supply</i>.
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
		There were more than 30,000 fire incidents that burned about 1.4 million acres. In 2020, wildfires were catastrophic with about 10 million acres were burned with about 59,000 fire incidents lost 10,000 structures and 33 fatal deaths. 		
	 </p>
	 <p>
		California spent about $700 million for suppression of the wildfires for the 2019/2020 fiscal year.
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 Akshara Yantra’s patent pending process uses combustion of biomass materials such as wood chips, herbs, grains, and milk products in limited quantities to generate <i>Nano / Atomic / Molecular Particles</i> that have high <b>Kinetic Energy</b> which attract water molecules/vapors in the atmosphere and interact with them to form the clouds and causes precipitation. In the process air pollution in the surroundings is reduced and the rainwater obtained would be clean and as neutral (pH value) as possible.  
	</p>
	<p>
Akshara Yantra is a research-oriented scientific company to address environmental and atmospheric challenges such as droughts, wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, air pollution, etc. Akshara Yantra aims to provide cost effective, clean, green, and innovative methodology using its patent pending <b>Biomass Combustion Process</b> to renew ecosystem, environment, and atmosphere.
