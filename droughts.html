	 West US States (UTAH, NEVADA, ARIZONA, CALIFORNIA, etc.) are facing moderate to severe Drought, and Wildfires due to lack of proper rains. This causes deficiency of water and power supply to agriculture, industries and residential usage. It is estimated that billions of dollars are spent to address the problem, but no suitable solution could be arrived at. <i>Akshara Yantra has a clean and green solution that can be implemented to obtain abundant rains that subsequently mitigates droughts and wildfires, restores water and power supply</i>.

		Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the US and a critical water supply for millions across the Southwest, has declined about 140 feet since 2000 and now sits at just 37% of full capacity.<br/><br/>

	 Akshara Yantra’s patent pending process uses combustion of biomass materials such as wood chips, herbs, grains, and milk products in limited quantities to generate <i>Nano / Atomic / Molecular Particles</i> that have high <b>Kinetic Energy</b> which attract water molecules/vapors in the atmosphere and interact with them to form the clouds and causes precipitation. In the process air pollution in the surroundings is reduced and the rainwater obtained would be clean and as neutral (pH value) as possible.

	<p>
Akshara Yantra is a research-oriented scientific company to address environmental and atmospheric challenges such as droughts, wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, air pollution, etc. Akshara Yantra aims to provide cost effective, clean, green, and innovative methodology using its patent pending <b>Biomass Combustion Process</b> to renew ecosystem, environment, and atmosphere.
