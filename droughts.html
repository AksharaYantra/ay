		<p class="sub-heading">

			our Patent Pending Technology to Mitigate Drought in West US States.

		<p>
			West US States (UTAH, NEVADA, ARIZONA, CALIFORNIA, etc.) are facing moderate to severe Drought, and
			Wildfires due to lack of proper rains. This causes deficiency of water and power supply to agriculture,
			industries and residential usage. It is estimated that billions of dollars are spent to address the problem,
			but no suitable solution could be arrived at. <i>Akshara Yantra has a clean and green solution that can be
				implemented to obtain abundant rains that subsequently mitigates droughts and wildfires, restores water
				and power supply</i>.
