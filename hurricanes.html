	 <p>
	 US States (Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, North and South Carolina, Mississippi, New York, Massachusetts, etc.) are facing moderate to severe Storms and Hurricanes due to the seasonality and global warming. It is estimated that billions of dollars are spent to address the problem, but no suitable proactive solution could be arrived at. <i>Akshara Yantra has a clean and green solution that can be implemented to mitigate the crisis</i>.
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
		2020 US Hurricane Season had a record-breaking number of storms – 30. Out of them, 14 were hurricanes and the remaining were major storms. 2020 remained tenth consecutive year with eight or more billion-dollar disasters. 		
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 Akshara Yantra’s patent pending process uses combustion of biomass materials such as wood chips, herbs, grains, and milk products in limited quantities to generate <i>Nano / Atomic / Molecular Particles</i> that have high <b>Kinetic Energy</b> which interact with water molecules/vapors in the atmosphere and reduce the intensity of the storm/hurricane. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Akshara Yantra conducted scientific experiments and applied its patent pending process to suppress hurricane intensities including (1) Irma Hurricane (on entering Georgia in September 2017), (2) Florence Tropical Storm (Greenville, South Carolina in September 2018), (3) Michael Hurricane (on entering Georgia in October 2018), (4) Dorian Hurricane (Jacksonville, Florida in September 2019), and (5) Claudette Tropical Storm (on entering Georgia in June 2021).
	</p>
	<p>
Akshara Yantra is a research-oriented scientific company to address environmental and atmospheric challenges such as droughts, wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, air pollution, etc. Akshara Yantra aims to provide cost effective, clean, green, and innovative methodology using its patent pending <b>Biomass Combustion Process</b> to renew ecosystem, environment, and atmosphere.
