	 Pollutants such Particulate Matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>), NO<sub>x</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, CO and greenhouse gasses such as Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), Ground Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), Nitrous Oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), and Chloro-Fluoro-Carbons (CFCs) from Vehicles and Industries are the culprit for acute and long-term ill-health, and Global Warming. It is estimated that billions of dollars are spent to address the problem, but no suitable preventive solution could be arrived at. Akshara Yantra has a clean and green solution that can be implemented to address Ambient Air Pollution caused by vehicles and industries.

	 Though US has too good measurements to control the emissions by reducing six major pollutants to 73 percent, CO2 emissions increased by 11 percent and US population increased by 46 percent. Due to record-breaking wildfires in West US, average particle pollution levels increased by 6.7 percent in 2020.

	 Akshara Yantra’s patent pending process uses combustion of biomass materials such as wood chips, herbs, grains, and milk products in limited quantities to generate <i>Nano / Atomic / Molecular Particles</i> that have high <b>Kinetic Energy</b> which attract water molecules/vapors in the atmosphere and interact with them to form the clouds and causes precipitation. In the process air pollution in the surroundings is reduced and the rainwater obtained would be clean and as neutral (pH value) as possible.  
	</p>
	<p>
		Akshara Yantra did various hundreds of experiments using its patent pending biomass combustion process on ambient air pollution focusing on each of the pollutants and greenhouse gases to get better handle on the pollution and observed great results.
	</p>
	<p>
Akshara Yantra is a research-oriented scientific company to address environmental and atmospheric challenges such as droughts, wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, air pollution, etc. Akshara Yantra aims to provide cost effective, clean, green, and innovative methodology using its patent pending <b>Biomass Combustion Process</b> to renew ecosystem, environment, and atmosphere.
